The TRN system–that has been called “FederNet”– that combines the strength of a convolutional neural network (CNN or convnet) with the robustness of projective invariants theory. FederNet is specifically designed for a lunar mission but its applicability could be furthed extended to other airless bodies.
The core algorithm is the crater detection algortihm (CDA), an implementation of a version of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)(modified by akTwelve) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow 2 for my master thesis. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of craters in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.


# Getting Started:

This script checks if Python is installed and then runs the setup.py file with the develop command, installing the specified dependencies and setting up the mmdetection project.

Install the script with:
```
source  runscripts/install.sh
```

# The repository includes:
* Source code of crater detection algorithm (CDA) 
* Source code of crater matching algorithm (CMA) 
* Source code of position estimation algorithm (PEA)
* Implementation of the EKF, through filterpy library
* Pre-trained weights for Lunar DEM LOLA-KAGUYA
* Datasets of training, test and validation (instance segmentation)
